# Find a GitHub Users Favourite Language

## Client Specification

- We would like you to build an application that allows users to enter an arbitrary Github username and be presented with a best guess of the Github user's favourite programming language.
- You may use any programming language, framework, or library.

## Setup

Copy the following code into your terminal and hit enter

```
git clone https://github.com/clovellbsc/github-users-favourite-language.git
```

Change directory into the project by copying the following code into your terminal and hitting enter

```
cd github-users-favourite-language
```

## Ensuring Dependencies Are Installed

if you do not have node installed on your device you can go to the [NPM documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm "NPM documentation")

if/once you have node installed on your device copy the following code into your terminal and hit enter

```
npm install
```

## Running The Application

Once you are ready to use the application type the following and hit enter
